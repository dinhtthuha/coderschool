My first steps into data scienece with Coderschool

# Weekly project

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in North America since 1946. The league is composed of 30 teams and is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States.

The NBA's regular season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games. As of 2020, NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.

The dataset consists of 2 tables about NBA players and their stats in games throughout seasons since 1950.

Well, should we just do some statistical calculations to find out the central tendency and dispersion of their height, weight, career length distribution? Or to list out the tallest and lightest ones, which everybody seemed to have done it already?

And then ...

üñê Seeing the birth_date column made me think of a kinda outrageous idea, which is

classifying NBA players based on their astrological signs and elements ‚≠ê and
comparing these groups to find out if there is any outstanding physical attribute and performance among them üèÄ.
