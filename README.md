Overview
The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in North America since 1946. The league is composed of 30 teams and is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States.

The NBA's regular season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games. As of 2020, NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.

The dataset consists of 2 tables about NBA players and their stats in games throughout seasons since 1950.

The dataset focuses individually on evey player by two tables:

Table 'Players' (4549 players): provides basic background information on name, birth date, NBA career length and some physical attributes such as height and weight.

Table 'Seasons' (3291 players) : lists personal advanced stats for each NBA season since 1950. We can have access to data ranging from 'positions' to efficiency metrics (such as: field goal, rebounds, assist, steal, block, point, true shooting, win share, etc.)
